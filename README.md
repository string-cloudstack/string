# string
The USC ETC string project for media asset identification
Online repository of calculated asset IDs and associated metadata services
Register and query online services and metadata

1. CLOUD repository of asset IDs and associated online metadata services.
2. Service providers and other entities who touch the asset may create metadata that can be referenced from the registry.  Each entity may have a local database of metadata which then will publish links into the String cloud service.
3. One of our charters is that we will not release any inherent confidential information tied to an asset without the creator/owner’s explicit permission.  To do so, in Phase 1 we will only publish links to the service provider’s internal database of metadata.  Authorization to this information will be the responsibility of the service provider for now.
4. In the future we may link authentication systems using the Keystone cloud framework.
